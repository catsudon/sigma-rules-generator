## What are Sigma Rules?

To have a better of Sigma Rules, you might want to know about Sigma.

So what exactly is Sigma?     
To quote [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sigma),

>**Sigma**  
A popular, successful, but highly independent and self-reliant person. Typically a male.
One step **above** an alpha male.  
*Unlike the simps of twitch, David was a sigma male as evidenced by his work ethic and the women throwing themselves at him.*
